// what do i need to do
/* 
1. instantiate what the board should first look like when loaded
2. on click...
    a. place a marker at that position (rerender the button so it includes an x/o in it)
        The click is player X
    b. check if this is a winning play (or a tie)
        IF it is, then send alert -> winning message
    c. prevent being clicked on again
    d. switch the next click to be that of player O
    e. 
3. have a button available that always resets the game to starting board state
    remember, player X must be first again
4. 

we are going to add EventListeners to... something.



EXTRA
add a button to the winning/tie alert that will allow for game to be reset
